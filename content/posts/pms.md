My programming career has reached its 4th year in length (At time of writing). Within these years I have come across numerous PMs (Project/Product). Recently, my company has had its fair share of PM rotations. When I discussed this incertainty of PMs with my supervisor, he did mention something close to this:
- "Good PMs are hard to come across, even more harder to judge during recuritment. We need to take our chances with one or the other, try working with them for few weeks and see if stuff pans out alright."

After a while I randomly thought, this whole process is very expensive. An average hiring process in most companies I've worked with is roughly 3 months (between resume received to actually getting onboard). For each candidate we also need to spend at least 10 hours judging them in various forms (looking at their resume/interviewing the candidate/group discussions). After all that, my experienced collegues who has 2x my work experience still have next to no idea about whether the candidate will work with us.

With that being said, maybe a recollection of my past PMs would come in handy for us fellow programmers. If we were to hire one or judge one.
