 Dan Luu has a great blog and his narrative is interesting to me, I figured that&rsquo;s a good way to write about the rambling thoughts that I sometimes find important to keep track of, or just to follow up on the ramblings that I find worthy. I find myself ramble on a lot about a variety of stuff to people, or myself, with a blog I can share all these ramblings.">

<p>Hello there, my name is Johnny. I started this blog due to the reasons below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dan Luu has a <a href=https://danluu.com>great blog</a> and his narrative is interesting to me, I figured that&rsquo;s a good way to write about the rambling thoughts that I sometimes find important to keep track of, or just to follow up on the ramblings that I find worthy.</li>
<li>I find myself ramble on a lot about a variety of stuff to people, or myself, with a blog I can share all these ramblings.</li>
<li>Keeping track of an individual&rsquo;s current state is very important, since a clear, good track record will help recognize growth, changes of views, standpoints on certain topics very easily, and a blog is one good tool for that.</li>
<li>I kinda always wanted to have my own little ground on the internet.</li>
<li>I want to know how well I write.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there you go, this is what it turned out for me. I hope you enjoy this blog as much as I&rsquo;ve enjoyed writing every word here :)</p>
