Dan Luu has this great [post](https://danluu.com/learning-to-program/) about how he learned to program. I liked this quote from that post:

> I like this idea because I've found that the paths that people take to get into programming are much more varied than stereotypes give credit for, and I think it's useful to see that there are many possible paths into programming.

There are indeed a bunch of ways that people can get into coding. At least for me, I have not seen guys with overlapping career paths. Most guys that I worked with don't do the stereotyped career path<sup>1</sup> either. But since I don't know their career paths in details (couldn't possibly have since I'm not them), this post will be about my path and how I think each phase contributed to my current status.

## Before University

When I was a little kid, my mom had a laptop. Since she's usually busy at work, me and my sister got to use the laptop whenever we felt like it. At that point I feel computer and the internet is a much broader world than the actual world so I kinda used it a lot. I mostly use the laptops and the crappy internet when I'm feeling alone and bored with the actual world. Online chat rooms were such a life saver at those times, even though the conversations would be kind of silly since I was only a kid. Nevertheless, it made me realize that computers can do the unthinkable things, and it can come in handy in situations. I kind of got hooked to computers ever since.

When GTA 4 came out, I was very into modding it ever since I found out that it's as easy as just changing the numbers in some random txt files and restart then BOOM! My car in game can go super fast or super durable, depending on which number you changed. Back then I thought all modding is just as simple as that and I tried opening random stuff with text editors to know that most game/applications doesn't work like that. I guess you can call that programming.

Also, I had a translator<sup>2</sup> that's capable of writing and executing BASIC programs. I remembered I code up a program that draws 1 circle at the top left of the screen. Even though it's interesting to see a semi-computer work to my will through codes, I don't know what else it can do for me and I just stopped their. I think that's the earliest chunk of code I've ever written.

## University

This is where I actually started learning to code up stuff as a computer science major. For the first 2 years I did learn how to code single algorithms with 1 file, compiling them and execute them against a online judge system most of the times. To be perfectly candid<sup>3</sup>, I wasn't interested at all. I thought it was pretty frustrating since I wasn't gifted enough to finish all assignments on time. I wasn't sure if this is going to work out for me. Luckily, I got through the first 2 years with mediocre scores in programming related classes.

My degree required a presented project at a yearly presentation event. Theoretically, if you finish it during your junior year, you have one chance to fail at it and you can still graduate on time by running it back during your senior year. I got recruited by my friends to do a augmented reality project. I handled the coding work, and I count that as my first program that I've ever delivered. It was a Unity project with a bunch of C# code for UIs and visual effects. The project was accepted (it counts toward my graduation), but didn't win any awards across the event.

After that, I took on a virtual reality project by myself. As a student in a virtual reality class. The end-semester presentation allows groups of different numbers. I chose to do a thing for myself since code-wise, I have just put together a augmented reality application using Unity, after a little research it's apparent that it can accomplish VR stuff as well. This time I made a time bomb game. The time bomb will spawn in random directions, the player is supposed to gaze at them to defuse them. The bombs wil explode in decreasing time. The player's score is their amount of defused bombs. There's a lot more code to be done this time than the last one, so I actively tried to split my code by usages, hoping that my structure can make sense to me whenever I need to debug my stuff<sup>4</sup>. I believe this is the first time that I didn't jump right into code. I actually tried to think and plan technical stuff for the future. Also, I started using auto-complete more vigorously because it often helped me discover some unknown C# methods. In the end, I passed the class with a A- score.

Somewhere later in my senior year, there were very little credits that I need. As a ordinary college student at this point, there were very little required things to do, you got all the time in the world. I figured that I should do something just for myself, a little coding project of my own. Turns out it's a better option (life-wise) than just shooting my time away on the basketball courts<sup>5</sup>. At the time, one of my friends would always take taxi rides when he's coming back to the campus from other cities. An idea then occurred to me that, what if there's an app that helps you with calling reputable taxi drivers for your next fare ?

So, to begin, I put together a Taxi credit lookup iOS app where you can lookup credits/comments by license plate. It had the basic CRUD functionality ready, but the UI is very rough (iirc, more than 60% of all UIs were just plain white) since I didn't have any artistic touches in me.

## Conclusion

1. A typical stereotyped career for programmers/engineers in Taiwan, based on my observations, is assumed by the majority to be like this:
   1. Finish college in a national university, majoring in something related to engineering.
   2. Get Master's degree on some kind of engineering in top universities.
   3. Go to a IC design house to design chips and hardware stuff.
   4. Buy new houses, get nice cars, live happily ever after.

2. It's a gadget/hand-held device that has several apps bulit-in, mostly translating ones. 
   
   This one looks a lot like the one I had.

   I'm very surprised that the company (BESTA) is still alive and selling [these](https://www.besta.com.tw/zh-tw/Product/digital_learn/ProductList/ElectronicDictionary), I guess smartphones and internet didn't overtake their market completely. I can't remember the exact machine I had, but I do believe that it's one of my parents' best investment considering how much stuff it helped me accomplished.

3. Line stolen from Charles Boyle and Rosa Diaz in Brooklyn 99. It's a great show and I love it.
4. In retrospect, it's funny how I can implement things with this notion back then, but in my first job and second job I've always lacked planning for the reasonably long term.
5. Looking back, I think I've played basketball easily more than 20 hours every week. It's crazy that I've done more basketball hours than class hours. One thing that all those hours have taught me is that I probably couldn't compete at the next level. (All I had was range with consistent shooting and acceptable perimeter defense, nothing else was cooking for me). I sometimes wish that I could realize it earlier, but I also felt it's unavoidable that it has to take this long (up until the senior year) for this revelation to reach me.
