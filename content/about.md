Hello there, my name is Johnny. I started this blog due to the reasons below:
- Dan Luu has a [great blog](https://danluu.com) and his narrative is interesting to me, I figured that's a good way to write about the rambling thoughts that I sometimes find important to keep track of, or just to follow up on the ramblings that I find worthy.
- I find myself ramble on a lot about a variety of stuff to people, or myself, with a blog I can share all these ramblings.
- Keeping track of an individual's current state is very important, since a clear, good track record will help recognize growth, changes of views, standpoints on certain topics very easily, and a blog is one good tool for that.
- I kinda always wanted to have my own little ground on the internet.
- I want to know how well I write.

Some technical details:
- Site is built with: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- Theme: [Archie Theme](https://github.com/athul/archie)

And there you go, this is what it turned out for me. I hope you enjoy this blog as much as I've enjoyed writing every word here :)
